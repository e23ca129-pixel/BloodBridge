Save images used by the site (background and logo).

- Background image: save the hero image as `static/images/hemabg.jpg`.
- Logo image: save your logo file as `static/images/logo.png` (recommended formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`).

After placing the files, restart the app and hard-refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5) to see the updated hero background and logo in the navbar and footer.
